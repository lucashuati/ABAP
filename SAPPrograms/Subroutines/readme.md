# SUBROUTINES
1.	Read a number between 0 and 100 and another digit between 0 and 9. Write a subroutine that will calculate the sum of all numbers (below the limit) that end with the digit. The parameters to be passed are limit and digit both by value and sum by reference.
  <br /><br />Ex. If limit = 67 and digit = 4 then sum should be the sum of 4, 14, 24, 34 … 64.

2.	Write a subroutine CENTRE-STRING, which will output a string on the center of a line. The subroutine will accept parameters STRING pass by value.

3.	Write a program extensively using subroutines to print the equivalent number in words.
For example: if the number is 66, the output should be SIXTY-SIX.
Limit the number range from 0 – 99.
Accept the input number as a parameter.

4.	Accept a date from the user.
Write a date as dd-mm-yyyy where mm is month written as JAN/FEB/Mar…etc.
Make use of subroutines.

5.	For each flight connection, calculate the sales for all flights of an airline carrier. Use internal table for calculating the sales. Use a subroutine for the output by passing the internal table as the parameters
